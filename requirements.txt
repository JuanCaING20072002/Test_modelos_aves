Pillow

# Pinned heavy ML packages - use Python 3.10 on the host
tensorflow==2.17.1
pennylane==0.41.0
ml-dtypes>=0.5.1,<1.0.0
# If your model requires jax/jaxlib, install compatible versions for CPU:
# jax==0.4.26
# jaxlib==0.4.26

# Notes:
# - Streamlit Cloud may still fail to build these wheels depending on the
#   platform's available Python version and system libs. For reliable hosting,
#   prefer a Docker-based deploy (Cloud Run, Render with Docker, etc.).
